Pivot scanning limited artifacts. Tiled z-stacks (10% overlap) were stitched in Zen Blue."

Downsampled autofluorescence images were registered (MIRACL) to an iDISCO+/LSFM version of the Allen brain atlas (CCFv3). c-Fos-IF images were rolling ball background subtracted, warped to atlas space, z-scored, and smoothed. Voxel-wise analyses were performed with randomise_parallel (FSL) according to a 2x2 ANOVA design (6,000 permutations). False positives in F-contrast maps were limited by false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Surviving clusters were warped to full resolution tissue space for post hoc cell density comparisons using cell segmentations from Ilastik."
