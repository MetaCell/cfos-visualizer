  "Experiment details": "For TRAPing, mice were injected with 4-OHT and psilocybin or saline. Two-weeks later, mice were again injected with psilocybin or saline (crossover design) and placed in their assigned context for 2 hours before fixation for c-Fos mapping. Brains were hemisected, immunostained, cleared, and imaged in 3D with a Zeiss Lightsheet 7 (2.5x objective; 0.52x zoom; 3.5 isotropic resolution; 10.61 µm sheet thickness). 488 nm light excited autofluorescence (8% of 30 mW; 505-530 nm; 50 ms). 638 nm light excited IF (20% of 75 mW; 660 nm long pass; 50 ms). Pivot scanning limited artifacts. Tiled z-stacks (10% overlap) were stitched in Zen Blue.",

    "description": "We developed UNRAVEL to automate c-Fos mapping. Downsampled autofluorescence images were registered (MIRACL) to an iDISCO+/LSFM version of the Allen brain atlas (CCFv3). c-Fos-IF images were rolling ball background subtracted (4-pixel radius), warped to atlas space, z-scored, and smoothed (50 µm). Voxel-wise analyses were performed with randomise_parallel (FSL) according to a 2x2 ANOVA design (6,000 permutations). False positives in F-contrast maps were limited by false discovery rate (FDR) correction and cluster extent (> 100 voxels). Surviving clusters were warped to full resolution tissue space for post hoc cell density comparisons using cell segmentations from Ilastik.",
